<div>
I am an undergraduate student of Sungkyunkwan University Computer Engineering major. <br>
I have taken many courses, and here I uploaded my works I have done on lectures. <br>
Below are explanations about works <br>
</div>
<h4> AI (Artificial Intelligence) </h4>
<div>
I uploaded my project. It was to classify documents. <br>
Feature extraction of documents was done using TF-IDF algorithm. <br>
And I desinged neural networks several times and compared the results.<br>
It was implemented using Keras <br>
I uploaded md files that contain result analysis.
</div>
<h4>
CV (Computer Vision)
</h4>
<div>
I uploaded several works.</div>
<div>
1. Implementations of edge detector and corner detector using Convolution Algorithm with several filters. <br/>
2. Implementations of  feature matching and warping. <br/>
3. Implementations of  image searching. I implemented this using clustering on image features extracted using SIFT. </div>
<h4>
PL  (Programming Language)
</h4>
<div>
It was to use one of C library, "flex/bison" <br>
Using this, I made a math expression parser <br>
& Kotlin Parser switching Kotlin code to Java code
</div>
<h4>
BD  (Big Data)
</h4>
<div>
My project was to classify given face images as male or female.<br>
I used Kernel SVM and I developed some kernel function optimized to this problem.<br>
But, it didn't perform better. I implemented on Python using SciPy library.
</div>
<h4>
DB (Database)
</h4>
<div>
Three implementations uploaded.<br>
1. B+ tree using C.<br>
2. simple web page using Django.<br>
3. simple multi threading using Hadoop.
</div>
<h4>
ML (Machine Learning)
</h4>
<div>
  There are four implementations and one term project. Works were usually done on skeleton codes. <br>
  They are all implemented using python.And Numpy and Keras libraries are used.<br>
1. Logistic regression.<br>
2. multi class classifier using single neural layer.<br>
3. Deep Neural Network.<br>
4. CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).<br>
* The project was about noisy data detection. <br>
  I implemented based on 'Identifying Mislabeled Data using the Area Under the Margin Ranking' paper.<br>
  </div>

<h4>
AL (Algorithm)
</h4>
<div>
Three implementations are uploaded. All of them are implemented using C<br>
1. Solving sorting problem using Bitmask and Radix sort on C.<br>
2. Solving sorting problem using Dynamic Programming.<br>
3. Parsing input string and encoding them using Huffman Tree.
</div>
